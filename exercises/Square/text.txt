# Difference of Squares Calculation

This C program contains functions that compute the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares of the first \( n \) natural numbers. The key mathematical concepts used in this implementation are based on the formulas for squaring a sum and summing squares.

## Functions

### `unsigned int tosquare(unsigned int n)`

This function takes an unsigned integer `n` as input and returns its square.

**Parameters:**
- `n`: An unsigned integer to be squared.

**Returns:**
- The square of `n`.

---

### `unsigned int square_of_sum(unsigned int n)`

This function calculates the square of the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers.

**Parameters:**
- `n`: An unsigned integer representing the number of natural numbers to sum.

**Returns:**
- The square of the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers.

---

### `unsigned int sum_of_squares(unsigned int n)`

This function computes the sum of the squares of the first \( n \) natural numbers.

**Parameters:**
- `n`: An unsigned integer representing the number of natural numbers to consider.

**Returns:**
- The sum of the squares of the first \( n \) natural numbers.

---

### `unsigned int difference_of_squares(unsigned int n)`

This function calculates the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares of the first \( n \) natural numbers.

**Parameters:**
- `n`: An unsigned integer representing the number of natural numbers to consider.

**Returns:**
- The difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares.

## Example Usage

```c
#include "difference_of_squares.h"

int main() {
    unsigned int n = 5;
    unsigned int difference = difference_of_squares(n);
    printf("Difference of squares for first %u natural numbers is: %u\n", n, difference);
    return 0;
}
